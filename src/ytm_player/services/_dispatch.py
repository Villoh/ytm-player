"""Bridge coroutine callbacks from foreign OS threads onto the asyncio loop.

The platform media-key services (Windows pynput, macOS event-tap and Now
Playing) receive key events on their own OS threads and must run the app's
async player callbacks on the event loop.  Scheduling ``asyncio.ensure_future``
without keeping a reference lets the garbage collector reclaim the pending task
mid-flight — the same footgun ``services/player.py`` guards against by holding
task refs.  This module centralises the safe idiom and the shared callback type.

``asyncio`` is imported lazily inside the dispatch function on purpose: importing
it at module top would pull asyncio's win32 branch (which needs the ``_overlapped``
extension) when ``services/mpris.py`` — which imports ``PlayerCallback`` from here
unconditionally — is imported under a faked win32 ``sys.platform`` by the MPRIS
platform-guard test.  The type alias needs only ``collections.abc``.
